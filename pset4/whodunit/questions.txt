0. stdint.h is a header file which defines a number of different integer types of different sizes and that are both signed and unsigned.
1. The usage of these new int types allows you specify the exact size of the variable you will be using so that different systems will not create ints of
different sizes, while also allowing you to specify the size of your variables to a more extensive and accurate degree so that you waste less resources.
2. BYTE is 1 byte, DWORD is 4 bytes, LONG is 4 bytes, and WORD is 2 bytes
3. BM
4. bfsize is the size of the entire image file, whereas bisize is simply the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure.
5. If biHeight is negative, that means that the information is stored from the top to the bottom with the origin being the top left corner.
6. biBitCount
7. If the file does not exist, fopen() will return NULL.
8. This argument is always one because in every case it is used either there is only one piece of information being searched for, or there is some other
function, such as a for loop, which accounts for the movement through the code.
9. 3
10. fseek() sets the position of the file pointer within the file.
11. SEEK_CUR is the current location within the file.
